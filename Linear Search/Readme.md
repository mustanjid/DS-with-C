# Linear Search is an algorithm to find an item in a list following linear line based finding.

### Algorithm of Linear Search:
1. Step 1: Start
2. Step 2: Set i, j
3. Step 3: Run a for loop from i to size
        repeat step 
4. Step 5: if A[i] == search_item
        yes, print search_item has found
        No, search item does not exist
5. Step 7: update i
6. Step 9: End
