Selection sort is an algorithm normally used to sort number in ASC or DESC manner in a list.

Algorithm of selection sort (ASC):
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Set i, j, temp
Step 3: Run a for loop from i to size
        repeat step 
Step 4: Run another for loop from j=i+1 to size
        repeat step
Step 5: if arr[i] > arr[j]
        yes, set temp = arr[i]
             set arr[i] = arr[j]
             set arr[j] = temp
Step 5: update j
Step 6: update i
Step 7: Print sorted array
Step 8: End
