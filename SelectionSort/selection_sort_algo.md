# Selection sort is an algorithm normally used to sort number in ASC or DESC manner in a list.

### Algorithm of selection sort (ASC):
1. Step 1: Start
2. Step 2: Set i, j, temp
3. Step 3: Run a for loop from i to size
        repeat step 
4. Step 4: Run another for loop from j=i+1 to size
        repeat step
5. Step 5: if arr[i] > arr[j]
        yes, set temp = arr[i]
             set arr[i] = arr[j]
             set arr[j] = temp
6. Step 5: update j
7. Step 6: update i
8. Step 7: Print sorted array
9. Step 8: End
