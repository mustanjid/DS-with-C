# Bubble sort is also a sorting algorithm normally used to sort elements following ASC or DESC manner in a list.

### Algorithm of Bubble sort (ASC):
1. Step 1: Start
2. Step 2: Set i, j, temp
3. Step 3: Run a for loop from i to size
        repeat step 
4. Step 4: Run another for loop from j to size
        repeat step 5, 6
5. Step 5: if arr[j] > arr[j+1]
        yes, set temp = arr[j]
             set arr[j+1] = arr[j]
             set arr[j] = temp
6. Step 6: update j
7. Step 7: update i
8. Step 8: Print sorted array
9. Step 9: End
